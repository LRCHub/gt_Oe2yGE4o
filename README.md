(Okay)
(Phew, phew)
(Phew, phew)
(Phew, phew)
Ayy
I'm four man deep in this German
And I'm whippin' it round
the suburban
Plod are on chase,
gotta make the excursion
So I manage this shit like I'm Jürgen
Went from Henny
to sippin' on Bourbon
I've switched to a different person
Cut to the chase,
now they call me the surgeon
All over the net, I'm a burden
I'm a warlord,
kilos under the floorboards
Rammin' the whip
through the store door
EsDeeKid, I'm from Mordor
I'm puttin' me name
on the scoreboard
Pull up, I've gotten me sword drawn
I'm rotten,
I'm sick when I pour fours
Every time I smoke,
I light four Raws (Okay)
I pull up in that Lamborghini
just so you can see me
All these people
wanna get dropped on
All these people,
they wanna be me
Me leather jacket's
from East Asia
And I'm smokin' up
on these beast flavours
Got little kiddas and bigger hitters
that'll bang you up
for the wee favour
I'm four man deep in this German
And I'm whippin' it
round the suburban (Okay)
Plod are on chase,
gotta make the excursion
So I manage this shit
like I'm Jürgen (Okay)
Went from Henny
to sippin' on Bourbon
I've switched to a different person
Cut to the chase,
now they call me the surgeon
All over the net, I'm a burden
I'm a scumbag,
I was raised
in Liverpool slums, lad (Okay)
I was broke, no joke,
but I spun back
Now I sip this rum
and I fund packs (Okay)
I'm a dirty dog, I'm a young rat
Year 10, I was out,
had to run cash (Okay)
PayPal, flip quids for the dumb tax
Catfish as a bitch for the dumb stack
I kept learning, kept lurkin'
Kept whippin' 'round and workin'
Me pockets filled
with twenty buds and GBP,
that's Sterling
I'm rolling round
in spenny cars
Got heavy gas that I'm burnin'
I'm a rockstar
with these rocks, lad
I could never beat these urges (Okay)
I'm four man deep in this German
And I'm whippin' it
round the suburban (Okay)
Plod are on chase,
gotta make the excursion
So I manage this shit
like I'm Jürgen (Okay)
Went from Henny
to sippin' on Bourbon
I've switched to
a different person (Okay)
Cut to the chase,
now they call me the surgeon
All over the net,
I'm a burden (Okay)
I'm a warlord,
kilos under the floorboards (Okay)
Rammin' the whip
through the store door
EsDeeKid, I'm from Mordor (Okay)
I'm puttin' me name
on the scoreboard
Pull up, I've gotten me
sword drawn (Okay)
I'm rotten,
I'm sick when I pour fours
Every time I smoke,
I light four Raws
